# GraphQL, Explained

```notes
- Like writing SQL, but to a JSON endpoint
- Open-source, built by Facebook
```
---
> Ask for what you need, get exactly that

```notes
- Most REST APIs return the entire record (or records), when all you really want is a title
```
---
## Describe your data

```graphql
type Project {
  name: String
  tagline: String
  contributors: [User]
}
```

```notes
- Define the type with all possible fields
- This allows GraphQL to be self-documenting
- Tools can introspect which fields are available
```
---
## Ask for what you want

```graphql
{
  project(name: "GraphQL") {
    tagline
  }
}
```

```notes
- I want the project
- Named graphql
- But I only need the tagline
```
---
## Get predictable results

```json
{
  "project": {
    "tagline": "A query language for APIs"
  }
}
```
---
# More cool things
---
## Get many resources with a single request

```graphql
{
  hero {
    name
    friends {
      homeWorld {
        name
        climate
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---
## Code as Documentation

- types and fields, not endpoints
- all data from a single endpoint
- clear and helpful errors
- avoid writing manual parsing code
---

---
## No API versioning

- add new fields and types without impacting existing queries
- aging fields can be deprecated and hidden from tools
- give apps access to new features and encourage cleaner, more maintainable server code

# Directives

```graphql
query Hero($episode: Episode, $withFriends: Boolean!) {
  hero(episode: $episode) {
    name
    friends @include(if: $withFriends) {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

# Fragments
---
export default FullScreenCode

```graphql
{
  leftComparison: hero(episode: EMPIRE) {
    ...comparisonFields
  }
  rightComparison: hero(episode: JEDI) {
    ...comparisonFields
  }
}
â€‹
fragment comparisonFields on Character {
  name
  appearsIn
  friends {
    name
  }
}
```

# Mutations

```graphql
mutation CreateReviewForEpisode($ep: Episode!, $review: ReviewInput!) {
  createReview(episode: $ep, review: $review) {
    stars
    commentary
  }
}
```
```json
{
  "ep": "JEDI",
  "review": {
    "stars": 5,
    "commentary": "This is a great movie!"
  }
}
```

```json
